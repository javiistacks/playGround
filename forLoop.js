//example of a for loop that 


// Create a program that loops from 5 to 10 
// and logs each number to the console
for (let counter = 5; counter < 11; counter++) {
    console.log(counter);
  }
  //prints numbers 5 to 10
  

  //we can loop backwards with a for loop by changing the operator
  for (let counter = 10; counter >= 0; counter--) {
    console.log(counter);
  }
  //prints numbers 10 to zero.
